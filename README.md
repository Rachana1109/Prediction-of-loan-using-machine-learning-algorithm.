ABSTRACT


With the enhancement in the banking sector lots of people are applying for bank loans but the bank has its limited assets which it has to grant to limited people only, so finding out to whom the loan can be granted which will be a safer option for the bank is a typical process. So in this project we try to reduce this risk factor behind selecting the safe person so as to save lots of bank efforts and assets. This is done by mining the data of the previous records of the people to whom the loan was granted before. So the idea of this project is to gather loan data from multiple data sources and train machine learning algorithms on this data and to deploy this model we use flask framework which redirects it to a web browser that predicts loan approval/rejection. This model can be used by the organizations in making the right decision to approve or reject the applicants request.
